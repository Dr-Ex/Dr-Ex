Hiya,

I'm mainly a musician (used to study Comp Sci) :violin::notes:  
&ensp;but I love experimenting with low level programming :floppy_disk::suspect::thought_balloon:  
&ensp;&ensp;and all music related electronic gizmos. :iphone::sound:  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;(Maybe with some games in there too) :godmode: 
      
Cheers!
